# cljrefactor.vim

## Installation

First, set up [cider-nrepl][] and [vim-fireplace][] following their respective
installation notes. As indicated in fireplace, cljrefactor.vim doesn't provide
indenting or syntax highlighting, so you'll want [a set of Clojure runtime
files](https://github.com/guns/vim-clojure-static) if you're on a version of
Vim earlier than 7.4.  You might also want [leiningen.vim][] for assorted
static project support.

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [vundle.vim](https://github.com/vundle)
then simply copy and paste:

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help cljrefactor`.
